I want to build a customer-facing MVP web app for my fintech company, Beaverly®, that matches the minimalist, premium style of our current website (https://beaverlygithub.github.io/BeaverlySite/).

The app is for Chilla AI™ license users, and it should help with validating licenses, downloading their custom EA, and accessing onboarding material.

Build it with HTML, CSS (Tailwind preferred), and JavaScript. It should be fully static and easy to host on GitHub Pages.

Do NOT use backend or frameworks like React. Keep it lightweight and responsive.

🎯 Pages / Sections Needed:
1. Hero / Welcome Page
Headline: “Welcome to Your Chilla AI Dashboard”

Subheadline: “Autonomous Execution, Total Control.”

Minimal buttons: “Check My License” | “Get Started”

2. License Validator Page
Simple input form to enter MT5 Account ID

On submit:

If ID matches in /data/users.json, show license plan, expiry date, and download link for .ex5 file

Else: Show “Not found or expired. Contact support.”

Above simple input form: A place to download license credentials generator ex5. and pdf on how to install the ex.5 to get their details if they do not know how.

3. Download Center
After validation, show:

"Download Your EA" button (link to precompiled .ex5)

Embedded onboarding YouTube video

Link to PDF Guide

Link to FAQ

4. FAQ Page
Questions like:

Do I need a VPS?

Is my capital safe?

How is Chilla different from signal services?

What happens when my license expires?

5. Contact / Support Form
Use EmailJS to let users message directly

Fields: Name, Email, MT5 ID, Message

No backend, just email delivery

6. Embedded AI Assistant (Botpress)
Add floating chatbot bubble

Connect to Botpress (I’ll handle credentials)

💡 Visual Style
Minimalist, premium, elegant

TailwindCSS layout

Subtle hover effects

Inter or Neue font

Responsive and clean mobile layout

Keep it smooth and lightweight. I want to impress both users and investors with the simplicity and clarity of the experience. This is not a trading course or social app. It’s a serious tool for serious money.
